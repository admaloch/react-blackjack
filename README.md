# React blackjack game

<b>About this project:</b><br/> 
This is a project I'm currently working on and is a rework of a Node command line blackjack game, [GitHub link](https://github.com/admaloch/blackjack-node-app.). The intent of this project is to build upon the original app and take on the challenge of re-implementing it in React/TypeScript. It's also an opportunity to solidify my knowledge of Redux.

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/> 
--React<br/>
--Redux<br/>
--Typescript<br/>
--JavaScript<br/>
