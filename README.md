<h1>React Blackjack Game</h1>
<h2>About this Project:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is a rebuild of a command line blackjack game I built with Node JS -- <a href="https://github.com/admaloch/blackjack-node-app">Link to GitHub Repository</a></li>
  <li>This is fully featured blackjack game built with React, Redux and Router, complete with a UI and multiple players. </li>
  <li>A Firebase realtime DB is used to store redux store data and allow users to return to a previous game. </li>
  <li>The logic for the cards, deck and user data are all built from scratch and no APIs were used. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaways:</h2>
<li>This was a good opportunity to solidify React work flow, component structuring, implement new hooks, and develop a better understanding for component rerender cycles.
  <li>  The most challenging part of this was dealing with the many bugs that popped up. There were tons of asynchronous operations, effects loops, and timed operations so it was extremely tricky locating the source of issues when they popped up. </li>
  <li>Another challenge was the deck logic. No card deck APIs were used so this was all built from scratch to emulate a real deck of cards including updating on draw </li>
