<h1>React Blackjack Game</h1>
<h2>About this Project:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is a rebuild of a command-line blackjack game I built with Node JS -- <a href="https://github.com/admaloch/blackjack-node-app">Link to GitHub Repository</a></li>
  <li> This is a fully featured blackjack game built with the MERN stack, complete with a UI and support for multiple players. It includes all the typical features of a blackjack game, with custom-built logic for the cards, deck, and user dataâ€”no card/deck APIs were used in the development process. The backend is set up to store game sessions, allowing users to return to a previous game. The intent of this project was to solidify my proficiency in React component structuring, hooks, and to develop a deeper understanding of the component lifecycle and React re-rendering process. </li>

</ul>
<h2>Takeaways:</h2>

  <li>  The most challenging part of this was dealing with the many bugs that popped up. There were tons of asynchronous operations, effects loops, and timed operations so it was extremely tricky locating the source of issues when they popped up. </li>
  <li>Another challenge was the deck logic which was built from scrath to emulate a real deck including card removal and shuffle.</li>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>Backend hosted on Render.com free tier so it takes a few minutes to wakup after inactivity.</p>
